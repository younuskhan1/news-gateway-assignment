        <p class="mt-3 text-justify"><span class="font-extrabold">Answer :</span>
            Variable declaration in JavaScript is the process of creating a variable and giving it a name so that it can
            be used to store a value. A variable is a named container that holds a value, and can be used to store and
            manipulate data in a program. "var", "let", and "const" are all used in JavaScript to declare variables.
            However, there are many differences between let, var, and const in javascript in terms of how they behave
            and how they should be used.

        <h2 class="font-extrabold my-3">var</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">"var" is the oldest way to declare a variable in JavaScript. Variables declared
            with
            "var" have a
            function-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within the function in which they were declared. They
            also have "hoisting" behavior, which means they are accessible throughout the entire scope of the function,
            regardless of where they were declared. However, because of its function-level scope, variables declared
            with var can lead to unexpected behavior and are generally not recommended.</p>

        <h2 class="font-extrabold my-3">let</h2>
        <p class="text-justify"> "let" was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6) as an alternative to "var".
            Variables declared with
            "let" have the block-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they were
            declared. They also have the concept of the temporal dead zone, which means they are not accessible before
            they are declared.</p>

        <h2 class="font-extrabold my-3">const</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">"const" was also introduced in ECMAScript 6 and is used to declare variables that cannot
            be reassigned. This
            makes "const" variables useful for declaring constants, such as pi or the gravitational constant, which have
            a fixed value. Like "let", "const" variables have the block-level scope, and, they are not accessible before
            they are declared.</p>
        <P class="text-justify my-3"> However, it is recommended to use "let" and "const" over "var" when declaring
            variables
            in JavaScript
            because they have more predictable behavior, and "const" is the most recommended for defining constant
            values that you don't expect to change.</P>
